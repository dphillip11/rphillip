        <p>
            As an artist with a passion for illustration and animation, I bring creativity, skill, and dedication to
            every project I undertake. With expertise in <strong>Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Illustrator</strong>, I
            excel at crafting visually captivating artworks that breathe life into ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            My proficiency in <strong>After Effects</strong> and <strong>Toon Boom</strong> allows me to create dynamic and
            engaging animations, adding movement and personality to my illustrations. I love exploring the endless
            possibilities of animation and bringing stories to life through motion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having worked as a freelancer, I have honed my ability to collaborate effectively with clients and bring their
            visions to fruition. From initial concept to final product, I am committed to delivering exceptional results
            that exceed expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, my experience working with companies on projects from start to finish has provided valuable
            insight into the production process. I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, maintaining consistent
            communication, and working seamlessly with teams to achieve shared goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a unique blend of technical expertise and artistic flair, I am dedicated to creating captivating visual
            experiences that leave a lasting impression. I am excited to continue pushing boundaries in the world of
            illustration and animation, and I look forward to new opportunities to showcase my skills and passion.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my illustrator internship with Risidio from April 2023 to October 2023, I had the opportunity to work on
            exciting projects that showcased my creativity and dedication to the field of illustration and animation.
            I illustrated a captivating collection of screenwriters, which found application on websites and as an NFT
            collection. This project involved multiple concept pieces and the use of tools like <strong>Photoshop</strong> and
            <strong>AI</strong> to bring these screenwriters to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a part of this internship, I also created a series of engaging social media posts to raise brand awareness
            for the collection. This experience allowed me to develop a strong familiarity with AI art creation tools and
            techniques, enhancing my skillset.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I contributed to the design of an ordinal service website, which will soon feature NFT collections
            I've created. Some of these collections comprise up to 1000 unique images, showcasing the diversity of my work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond my individual projects, I actively supported and mentored other interns, offering advice and creative
            insights to help them improve their work. I am proud to have created a positive and collaborative atmosphere
            within the team.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm grateful for the recognition I received during my internship. As highlighted in a testimonial: "If anyone is
            looking for a role model for how to get the most out of their internship, you don't need to look any further
            than Raymond. He created a whole new category in his role in the design team and supported everyone. He's been
            one of the shining stars of this year - of all the years! Thank you again for all that you've contributed
            through your work, and I look forward to welcoming you back in the not too distant future."
        </p>
        <p>
            As I continue to explore the world of illustration and animation, I'm excited about the possibilities and eager
            to push boundaries. I'm always open to new opportunities to showcase my skills and passion, and I'm dedicated to
            creating captivating visual experiences that leave a lasting impression.

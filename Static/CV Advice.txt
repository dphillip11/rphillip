As a rule, don't undersell yourself. You are not inexperienced!

Talk about what you have done not what you will/want to do:
 eg. BAD: I am willing to learn new skills
	GOOD: I have a proven track record of learning new skills to accomodate the needs of a project
	EXTRA: Currently I am engaged in developing a 2D game using Unity where I have learned aspects of design relating to levels, gameplay and narrative
         and workflows specific to Unity for artwork, animation, sequencing and version control etc.

Emphasise soft skills that are important in a team, management being quite important
 eg. 
- management:
  managing a team of x people
  working collaboratively on interdisciplinary teams
  refinement of requirements and project direction through design
  coordinating tasks of art teams to reach delivery milestone
